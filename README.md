# Robot-Simulation
This project involves a physics engine to simulate and visualize the commands given to a 4DOF robotic arm 

The aim of this project is to simulate the motion of a 4DOF robotic arm while executing various commands given 
by the user. The project is in its early stages and thus it will be capable of executing only ramp signals.
However, it will be capable of simulating other continuous signals with via points as well.

The project is implemented with C++. The 3D rendering will be handle with OpenGL.

This is an ongoing project.
